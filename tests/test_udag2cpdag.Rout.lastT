 ... and today's fortune() cookie is:

Paul Gilbert: [code comparing speed of apply(z,2,sum) vs. rep(1,10000)%*%z)]
which seemed completely contrary to all my childhood teachings.
Douglas Bates: Must have had an interesting childhood if you spent it learning
about the speeds of various matrix multiplication techniques.
Paul Gilbert: [...] why is apply so slow?
Brian Ripley: `so slow' sic: what are you going to do in the 7ms you saved?
   -- Paul Gilbert, Douglas Bates and Brian D. Ripley (discussing `the
      incredible lightness of crossprod')
